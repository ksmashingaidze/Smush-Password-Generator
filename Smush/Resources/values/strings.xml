	<string name="aboutsmush1">Smush is a free password generator which allows the user to quickly create random or personalized passwords for use across their digital services. Passwords can be named and saved to the password bank for future reference. The user is also provided with the option of  locking passwords with a security question to prevent unauthorized access.</string>
	<string name="aboutsmush2">Random passwords must be 3-16 characters long, and must contain at least 1 of each character type.</string>
	<string name="aboutsmush3">Customized passwords, accessed using the drop-down menu or ‘Save’ button, provide greater flexibility and are not governed by the character type restriction. Spaces and new lines are not permitted in the title and password fields. Security questions are optional, and must be accompanied by a security response if they are used. New lines are not permitted in the security response.</string>
	<string name="aboutsmush4">Passwords can be saved to the password bank. If a password is protected by a security question, the correct security response must be entered in order to unlock it. To ensure optimum levels of security are maintained, saved passwords must be unlocked before they can be deleted.</string>
	<string name="aboutsmush5">I hope you enjoy using Smush. Bonsoir!</string>
